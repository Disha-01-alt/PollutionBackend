# Required Packages

For deploying the backend API server, you'll need the following packages:

```
flask
flask-cors
gunicorn
requests
beautifulsoup4
trafilatura
pandas
```

Install them with pip:

pip install flask flask-cors gunicorn requests beautifulsoup4 trafilatura pandas
```

Or using requirements.txt (if you create one outside of this environment):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
